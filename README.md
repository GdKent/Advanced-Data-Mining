# Advanced Data Mining Methods

This repo serves as a place where I can keep some data mining / ML projects that I've worked on. However, since teaching something is the best way to learn it, my goal with all of the projects I upload here is to be as clear and succinct about the correct methodology and explain different techniques that can be utilized in a data mining task.

Since this is called "advanced" data mining, I will not elucidate too much on the specifics of the actual code writing, as I assume that anyone interested in the content is at a coding level to follow it, and will mainly focus on explaining the methodology.
